## About

`adbi` provides an interface to the `adb` command.

`adbi` started as part of [keydroid](https://github.com/androbility/keydroid), but it quickly became apparent
that `adbi` should be a distinct entity so developers can use it to
build additional creative applications.


## Future plans

Add support for the full array of `adb` commands.
